/**
 * The shell-facing surface a feature's fragment optionally exposes, replacing concrete-type casts
 * (`as? SpotifyFragment` / `as? HomeAssistantFragment`) in the shell layer.
 *
 * Every method has a safe default so the shell can call through without checking which feature is
 * active. Features implement only the capabilities they actually support.
 *
 *  - [applyTimeFormat]      — Spotify: re-renders the clock immediately after a 24h toggle.
 *                             No-op on features that don't own a clock view.
 *  - [activeDashboardPath]  — Home Assistant: the url_path currently shown in the WebView, used
 *                             to mark the active chip in the shell bottom bar. Null on others.
 *  - [showDashboard]        — Home Assistant: navigates the WebView to [dashboard] AND re-marks the
 *                             chip row (it owns the active-path write). No-op on others.
 *  - [runDiscovery]         — Home Assistant: triggers JS-bridge dashboard discovery. No-op on others.
 *  - [reloadUrl]            — Home Assistant: reloads the WebView at the configured URL. No-op on others.

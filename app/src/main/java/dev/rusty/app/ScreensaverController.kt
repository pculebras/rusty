/**
 * Shell-owned screensaver = the idle/sleep layer over the active feature. It auto-shows when the
 * dashboard is idle (the active→idle edge, cold launch, idle-timeout), or on a manual clock tap,
 * and on wake it crossfades out while the destination fragment replays its bloom. State comes from
 * the observable [ReceiverStateStore]; a 1 Hz tick keeps the wall clock moving while showing.
 *
 * Wake is per-theme: a tap/key off the chrome buttons calls [ScreensaverTheme.onWakeGesture];
 * if the theme consumes it (e.g. OLED freeze+reveal) we stay, otherwise we exit with the bloom.
